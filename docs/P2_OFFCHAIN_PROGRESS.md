# P2 off-chain protocol progress

## Task 1 — platform execution retirement (2026-10-24)

The signer workspace, platform dispatcher, keeper, faucet worker, internal trader,
and single-maker quote/pricing service are retired. API modes now stop at
`markets`; preparation, approval, research and forecast work remain for Task 2.
Transaction observation remains in the indexer, with its port types isolated in
`packages/ports/src/tx-tracking.ts`.

Migration `0025_retire_platform_execution.sql` removes the retired storage and
roles without changing historical migrations. It dead-letters queued execution
and quote-reconciliation jobs with `RETIRED_P2`, clearing and fencing old leases.
Health, metrics, alerts, service bundles, container configuration and operational
drills now use the surviving infrastructure. Legacy SDK execution methods refuse
locally with `RETIRED_P2` pending the later client replacement. PostgreSQL tests
run serially because historical migrations create the cluster-wide roles that
0025 drops.

### Verification

- Required retirement tests failed before implementation: 6 passed, 2 failed.
- Focused regression suite: 174 passed, 0 failed.
- The single full `pnpm check` run passed TypeScript and contract checks, then
  reported 536 passing tests and 3 stale RFQ expectations in identity/scaffold
  tests. Those expectations were corrected; the complete affected suites plus
  the required retirement suites passed on rerun: 20 passed, 0 failed.
- Final TypeScript and dependency-boundary checks passed separately. The full
  15-minute command was not repeated after the test-only corrections, following
  the instruction to run full verification once.
- Final `pnpm build:services` and `pnpm test:service-build` passed: four bundle
  checks, no signer or trading-admin output.
- `pnpm build` reached the native Turbopack loader and failed because the host
  lacks GLIBC_2.29. The production Webpack fallback passed, including TypeScript
  checking and all 37 static pages.
- PostgreSQL suites, Docker image smoke, restore drill, and remaining Anvil suites
  were not run locally. Their affected tests/configuration were updated for CI.

The restore drill now checks infrastructure rows, schema, grants and cursor lease
recovery against a quiescent database. The old trading/contract roundtrip depends
on the retired Alpha harness; the replacement protocol harness remains later work.

This completes only the Task 1 implementation scope, not the P2 milestone. Later
tasks still own research/approval removal, protocol-facing APIs/indexing, clients
and documentation. No push, merge, deployment or live transaction was performed.
