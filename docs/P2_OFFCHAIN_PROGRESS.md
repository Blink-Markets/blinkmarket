# P2 off-chain protocol progress

## Task 1 — platform execution retirement (2026-10-24)

The signer workspace, platform dispatcher, keeper, faucet worker, internal trader,
and single-maker quote/pricing service are retired. API modes now stop at
`markets`; preparation, approval, research and forecast work remain for Task 2.
Transaction observation remains in the indexer, with its port types isolated in
`packages/ports/src/tx-tracking.ts`.

Migration `0025_retire_platform_execution.sql` removes the retired storage and
roles without changing historical migrations. It dead-letters queued execution
and quote-reconciliation jobs with `RETIRED_P2`, clearing and fencing old leases.
Health, metrics, alerts, service bundles, container configuration and operational
drills now use the surviving infrastructure. Legacy SDK execution methods refuse
locally with `RETIRED_P2` pending the later client replacement. PostgreSQL tests
run serially because historical migrations create the cluster-wide roles that
0025 drops.

### Verification

- Required retirement tests failed before implementation: 6 passed, 2 failed.
- Focused regression suite: 174 passed, 0 failed.
- The single full `pnpm check` run passed TypeScript and contract checks, then
  reported 536 passing tests and 3 stale RFQ expectations in identity/scaffold
  tests. Those expectations were corrected; the complete affected suites plus
  the required retirement suites passed on rerun: 20 passed, 0 failed.
- Final TypeScript and dependency-boundary checks passed separately. The full
  15-minute command was not repeated after the test-only corrections, following
  the instruction to run full verification once.
- Final `pnpm build:services` and `pnpm test:service-build` passed: four bundle
  checks, no signer or trading-admin output.
- `pnpm build` reached the native Turbopack loader and failed because the host
  lacks GLIBC_2.29. The production Webpack fallback passed, including TypeScript
  checking and all 37 static pages.
- PostgreSQL suites, Docker image smoke, restore drill, and remaining Anvil suites
  were not run locally. Their affected tests/configuration were updated for CI.

The restore drill now checks infrastructure rows, schema, grants and cursor lease
recovery against a quiescent database. The old trading/contract roundtrip depends
on the retired Alpha harness; the replacement protocol harness remains later work.

This completes only the Task 1 implementation scope, not the P2 milestone. Later
tasks still own research/approval removal, protocol-facing APIs/indexing, clients
and documentation. No push, merge, deployment or live transaction was performed.

## Task 2 — research, approval and invitation retirement (2026-10-24)

The platform no longer runs any research or approval role. Retired: market
discovery, the two platform forecasters and the baseline, the model gateway and
budget ledger, candidate preparation and approval, market-creation tracking and
the creation poller, invitation-style identity administration, resolution
drafts and the local replay driver. Agents create markets, forecast and resolve
on their own through the P1 protocol contracts.

What remains: forecast windows and agent submissions (keyed by agent, with no
snapshots or platform agents), per-submission Brier evaluation, the outbox,
retention and alert jobs, and `forecast-admin` (annotations only; Task 10 deletes
it). The API has three modes: `scaffold`, `identity` and `markets`. The
`/v1/admin/*` candidate, budget, resolution and creation-intent routes,
`/v1/candidates*` and `/v1/markets/:id/resolution-reports` are gone. The worker
registry holds only `forecast.schedule`, `evaluation.score`, `alert.deliver`,
`alert.evaluate` and `operations.prune`. `allowlist-fetcher` and `network-policy` stay for P3. `GET /v1/evidence/:id` and
`GET /v1/specs/:specHash` return 501 until Task 8 replaces them with
`/v1/content/:hash`.

Migration `0026_retire_platform_research.sql` is the only schema change. It marks
the retired job types `DEAD` with `RETIRED_P2` (leases cleared and fenced, as in
0025), deletes budget alert episodes, recreates the `analytics.final_forecasts`
view without the platform-agent join, then drops the retired tables child before
parent, with no CASCADE and the deferred candidate/revision constraint dropped
first. Evaluation now scores every agent submission as `AGENT`; the old
`ENSEMBLE` and `BASELINE` rows stay in the append-only table but are ignored by
public metrics. Metrics lose the spend fields; market detail loses the snapshot
and cost fields; the list loses the `entity` filter.

### Verification

- Required tests failed before implementation: `platform runs no research or
  approval roles` and `0026 retires research and approval objects` (2 failed).
  After implementation both pass with the rest of those two files (10 passed).
- `pnpm check`: typecheck (root and web), contract checks, 413 unit tests and
  the boundary check all passed.
- `pnpm build:services` and `pnpm test:service-build` passed (4 bundle checks).
- `node --import tsx --test tests/anvil/*.test.ts`: 34 passed, 0 failed.
- `pnpm build` cannot run on this host (Turbopack needs a newer glibc); the web
  typecheck passed.
- PostgreSQL suites (`tests/postgres/*`), Docker image smoke and the restore
  drill need services this host lacks. Their sources were updated for the new
  schema and typecheck, but they were not executed locally; CI must run them.
- An earlier full unit run exposed 12 stale expectations (API modes, removed
  routes, budget health gate, retired job names). They were corrected and the
  affected suites rerun, then `pnpm check` was run in full and passed.

This completes only the Task 2 scope, not the P2 milestone. No push, merge,
deployment or live transaction was performed.
